To display a map of the USA with population data, we can use the `folium` package in Python. Here's an example code:

```python
import folium
import pandas as pd

# Load population data
pop_data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2014_us_cities.csv')
pop_data['pop'] = pop_data['pop'].astype(float)

# Define map center and zoom level
map_center = [37.0902, -95.7129]
zoom_level = 4

# Create map object
map_usa = folium.Map(location=map_center, zoom_start=zoom_level)

# Add population markers to map
for index, row in pop_data.iterrows():
    folium.CircleMarker(location=[row['lat'], row['lon']],
                        radius=row['pop']/20000,
                        color='blue',
                        fill=True,
                        fill_color='blue',
                        fill_opacity=0.5,
                        tooltip=row['name']+"<br>"+str(row['pop'])+" population").add_to(map_usa)

# Display map
map_usa
```

This code uses a dataset of US cities with their population data from the Plotly library and plots them as circle markers on the map. The size of the markers is proportional to the population of the city.

You can customize the map by changing the `map_center` and `zoom_level` variables to focus on different regions of the USA. You can also change the color and size of the markers to suit your needs.
